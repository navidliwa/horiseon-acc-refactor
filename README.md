# Horiseon Homepage Accessibility Refactor

## Description

Horiseon is concerned with their site being accessible to the seeing-impaired and has asked us to refactor the code. The site did not have alt atributes on its images so the HTML has been edited to accomodate screen readers. The HTML has also been edited to include semantic elements for SEO and the CSS has been organized to reflect the semantic structure.

## Usage

This site can be viewed for information regarding Horiseon's services and benefits. The navigation bar at the top can be used to move to different parts of the page.
